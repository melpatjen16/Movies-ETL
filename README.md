# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this project was to to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. The first deliverable is  to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process, and finally, adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
